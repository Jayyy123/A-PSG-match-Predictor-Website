# A-PSG-match-Predictor
 Implemented using Supervised Machine Learning Models and added to the backend of a Full stack site I created using Django.


 I first had to scrape together a dataset for PSG's past matches from 2018/2019 till present(Going back any further would be pointless as a lot more players would be in the team that aren't present atall today)


 I then converted the data to a csv file

 After which I used a Random Forest Classifier to fit and train the data.

 I tested for the accuracy and got a 70% response which was less than what i expected

I moved to Django next and built the backend of my site before adding css over it


I added signup functionalities then went on to build the apis for the site

before finally moving on to the android app that would use this api...
